# Small Scale Hydroponic System

### Hydroponics in a Box

With the Maxellwell Community Garden, Morgan Academy High School and Dundee Central Library Code Club I have been helping develop a small scale DIY hydroponics system. We have encorporated the project into a plastic box which while the system is in use this will be used as the water resovare.

## Parts List
